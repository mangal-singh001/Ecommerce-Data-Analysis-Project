# 🛒 Ecommerce Data Analysis Project (Python + SQL)

This project focuses on solving real-world business problems using an **Ecommerce dataset** with thousands of rows. The data is uploaded into **MySQL** using **Python**, and insights are generated using both **SQL queries** and **Python-based data visualization**.

## 💡 Business Problems Solved

* 📈 Which products are the most sold?
* 💸 Which month generated the highest revenue?
* 📍 Which city has the most customers?
* ⏱️ What is the average order delivery time?
* 🔄 Payment method distribution

All questions are solved using SQL and/or Python.

## ⚙️ How to Use

### 1. Setup MySQL

Create a MySQL database and import table schemas (manually or via notebook).
You can create a database called `ecommerce`.

### 2. Upload CSVs Using Python

Open `csv_to_sql.py.ipynb` and execute the notebook.
It reads CSVs and uploads them into your MySQL tables using `mysql-connector-python`.

```bash
pip install pandas mysql-connector-python
```

---

## 📊 Visual Output (in notebook)

* Bar charts for top products
* Line graphs for revenue trends
* Pie charts for payment methods
* Customer city distribution

*All graphs are generated within the notebook using real-time SQL data.*

---

## 🔍 Sample SQL Queries

```sql
-- Top 5 selling products
SELECT product_id, COUNT(*) AS sales_count
FROM order_items
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY sales_count DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Monthly revenue trend
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m') AS month, SUM(payment_value) AS revenue
FROM orders
JOIN payments ON orders.order_id = payments.order_id
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```

## 📈 Future Enhancements

* Add a Streamlit dashboard
* Export charts and tables to Excel
* Automate daily reports via Python
